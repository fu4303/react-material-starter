# Create React App with Material UI (Template)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com) components and theming.

A preview is deployed at [vercel.com](https://material-ui-react-starter.vercel.app)

### Get Started Immediately

You **don’t** need to install or configure tools like webpack or Babel.<br>
They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

[Use this template](https://github.com/JoHoop/material-ui-react-starter/generate), and you’re good to go.
